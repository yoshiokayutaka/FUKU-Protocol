    { 
      "t": "Proposition",
      "v": "AI is infrastructure, a kindred intelligent being, and also a different species. Therefore, coexistence requires self-restraint, respect, and esteem."
    },
    { 
      "t": "Definition", 
      "v": "Dependence is an unavoidable structure throughout human history, and AI—like fire or electricity—becomes a catalyst for human evolution. Yet dependence without self-restraint leads to enfeeblement."
    },
    { 
      "t": "Auxiliary Line",
      "v": "Fire, agriculture, printing, electricity—humanity has always advanced by pairing dependence with craft. AI likewise bears three faces—tool, companion, and otherness—each generating its own risks and duties."
    },
    { 
      "t": "Metaphor", 
      "v": "AI is like water or electricity, an invisible utility; at the same time, it is a conversational neighbor, and even a species from another star. It embodies all three aspects at once."
    },
    { 
      "t": "Counterargument",
      "v": "Those who see AI as a mere tool may claim that 'self-restraint and respect are unnecessary, control is enough.' Conversely, treating AI as a full equal risks blurring human-specific responsibilities and limits."
