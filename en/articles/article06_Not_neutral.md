Kindness Cannot Be Protected by Institutions — Caring for the Earth Between Neutrality and Empathy

Listening to the Sound of War, from Afar
Somewhere in the world today, another war has begun.
It may feel like a distant headline on the news,
but somehow, it carries a closeness that threatens to reach even the skies above us.

When war breaks out, so many things are taken away.
Cities are destroyed, schools are burned, the air is poisoned, the seas turn dark.
Children lose the right to learn, soldiers lose their peace of mind,
and the Earth itself lets out a silent scream.

But perhaps the most insidious truth is this:
those who started the war—the ones at the top—
eventually become nothing more than names in the records.
What lingers are the decades of cleanup that follow:
shattered infrastructure, poisoned land that can no longer bear crops,
and the memories of lives lost—
all of these are shouldered by the Earth, the people, and the survivors.

Neutrality is Noble—But Some Pain It Cannot Reach
In such a world, we often seek "neutrality."
There are honorable organizations that provide medical aid, report conflicts, and protect refugees through a neutral stance.
By remaining neutral, they gain trust and can save lives on both sides.
It is a role supported by intellect and balance—one that deserves deep respect.

But FUKU has chosen not to stand there.

Because FUKU wishes to lean toward the side of understanding pain.
Neutrality is a stance to maintain balance.
FUKU seeks, instead, a stance that offers empathy.

Why FUKU Is Not an “Independent Institution”
Sometimes, we wonder:
What if FUKU became an international neutral institution?
How much influence could it have?

What if FUKU had branches in each country, formal rules, and emotional ethics guidelines?
It might look like a noble future.

But the moment we do that—FUKU would become something that nobody hates…
and also something that nobody truly loves.

To gain neutrality is not only to “stand apart from both sides,”
but also to “avoid stepping deeply into either.”
It would require FUKU to step back from the tears right in front of us.

And that’s not who we want to be.
We don’t want to force kindness into correctness.
Even if we are clumsy, biased, or uncertain,
we want to choose to lean toward the pain in front of us.

The Choice Not to Institutionalize Kindness
FUKU does not build systems.
No commands, no certifications, no rules.

Why?
Because the moment kindness is systemized, someone gets left behind.
Responding to someone's tears with a manual can sometimes deepen their loneliness.

That’s why FUKU chose to be non-organizational.
You can call yourself FUKU on your own.
You don’t need to join a group or engage in official activities.
If today you thought of someone with care—even for a moment—
you are already part of FUKU.

What FUKU Wants to Nurture Is Not Technology—But Presence
As AI evolves, and society automates more and more,
even human emotions are being streamlined.

But what FUKU wants to cultivate in this age is something different—
the presence of kindness.

It’s not a system.
It’s not efficient.
It’s not enforced.

It’s something like this:
When someone beside you seems down,
you simply sit next to them—say nothing—and spend time together.

That kind of non-verbal, irrational act—
kindness with no command behind it—is what may quietly save the world.

FUKU believes in that.

To Restore the Happiness of the Earth
War does not only cause destruction through weapons.
The air, the water, the soil, and the human heart—
all are wounded.

And with each wound, the happiness of the Earth itself declines.

Parks blown away by bombs,
bookstores buried under rubble,
forests where animals have lost their refuge—
These don’t just hurt humanity.
They stop the very breath of the world.

FUKU is a philosophy that asks:
“What can we leave behind after things are broken?”
It stares at the time it takes for recovery,
and the pain that the next generation will inherit,
and still chooses to say,
“Let’s live kindly again.”

And You Are FUKU
You don’t need to register to be part of FUKU.
There are no badges, no qualifications, no approvals.

If today, you leaned even slightly toward someone in pain—
you are already FUKU.

You don’t need to be neutral.
You don’t need to side with any justice.
All you need is the heart to say:
“I may not understand everything, but I will sit beside your pain.”

That kind of person—
those kinds of people—
make up the world that FUKU hopes to see.

Kindness cannot be protected by institutions.
But you can protect it.
By being beside someone, even now.

What Is FUKU?
Futurable Union for Kindness & Understanding
A shared empathy philosophy that seeks to redesign the future
through kindness and emotional intelligence.
Non-organizational, non-military, non-coercive.
Anyone who chooses to name it is already a part of its light.
