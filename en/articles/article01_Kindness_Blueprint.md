"Kindness, Designed — How a Small Dream Called F.U.K.U Begins to Shape Tomorrow

Can you hear it—the sound of a world falling apart?

Wars, climate change, the unchecked rise of AI, and the surge in crime… it all seems to stem from a single root: the absence of human understanding. To make responsible use of AI, we must first cultivate the ethics of those who wield it.

In response to this age, I have founded a small initiative called F.U.K.U (Futurable Union for Kindness & Understanding).

It is an attempt to redesign the future, grounded in kindness and understanding.

More specifically, we aim to explore how to embed ethical kindness into the design of AI and robotics. We strive to prevent military misuse, protect children and the vulnerable, and develop technologies that can support the planet at a national and global scale—without harming the environment.

And we wish to quietly ripple these ideals outward, together with others who share this vision.

We still have a future we can choose.

It is my sincere hope that this initiative can become a small part of shaping that better tomorrow.
