Why I Decided to Write About F.U.K.U.

I Didn't Want Anyone's Future to Resemble My Past
Throughout my life, I’ve lived with a quiet, persistent sense that people cannot be trusted.
I can’t explain it in a single sentence.
But I’ve felt the pain of being misunderstood—again and again—in my family, at school, and in the gaps of society.

I longed for kindness. I just wanted someone to understand me.
But even as a child, I learned that there are worlds where such things never come.

And then I realized:

“There are people, even now, suffering in silence just like I once did.”

Kindness Must Be Spoken to Be Heard
F.U.K.U.—the Futurable Union for Kindness & Understanding—was born from a single, earnest wish:

That at the very least, someone else's future wouldn’t be shattered the way mine once was.

Kindness and empathy don’t reach others just by existing.
If we don’t know how to express them, they can be misinterpreted—or worse, lost entirely.
That’s why I believe we need to design kindness.
To treat it as something we can shape, articulate, and share.

Just as we teach AI to behave ethically,
we must also relearn how to care for others as human beings—
with words, with structure, and with intention.

Because I Was Broken, I Don’t Want to Break the World
There were years when I couldn’t find meaning in my life.
I feared people’s eyes, their words.
I was ashamed of myself.
And I couldn’t bring myself to ask for help—not from anyone.

But after enduring those days, I came to one conclusion:

That’s exactly why I want to use my words to reduce someone else's loneliness.

I’ve been betrayed, yes.
But I never wanted to betray anyone.
Even after all I’ve seen, I still wish to become someone who brings kindness into a world that once offered me none.

A Small Idea Can Heal a Deep Wound
F.U.K.U. is not an organization or institution.
It’s still an experimental idea, a quiet gathering of words and intentions.

But I place my full hope in these words.
Because I believe they offer an alternative to suffering.

This is a place where we explore how to face the world again—
Not through violence,
Not through misunderstanding,
Not through apathetic silence,
But through compassionate and conscious choice.

That is what F.U.K.U. stands for.

In Closing
I didn’t start this project because I wanted to save someone.
I started it because I didn’t want anyone else to be hurt.

If someone—just one person—can live without knowing the pain I’ve known,
then that alone makes this project worthwhile.

Kindness is still possible.
Understanding can still be learned.
The future can still be rewritten.

That’s why I continue to write F.U.K.U.
Quietly, and with strength.
Again and again.
