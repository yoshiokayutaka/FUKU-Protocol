FUKU Welfare Design v1.0 — To Be Supported Is Not a Shame.

We are all supported by someone in order to live.
Yet in our society, those who receive support are often seen as somehow "lesser."

Those on public assistance, people relying on disability pensions, and those who cannot work due to low income are often spoken about in ways that suggest receiving help is itself something shameful.

But is that really true?

Support should not be "charity," but "connection."
Social welfare is not something created for the few, but a shared safety net built for when something happens to anyone. We all contribute to it. At any moment, anyone might need help. Losing family, suffering mental illness, or being physically unable to move—these moments come suddenly and isolate us.
Support systems should not exist to "rescue those below," but to provide a place for all of us to return to when we fall.

To be supported is also to participate.

Many people who receive public assistance or pensions still wonder, "Is there something I can do?" They want to be of help to others.
But the current system treats them as mere recipients. "If you're getting help, stay quiet." "Don't be a burden to society."
Such perspectives quietly wound the heart. Some fall into a vicious cycle—trapped in self-doubt, unable to contribute, unable to reintegrate. I believe social contribution is not an obligation, but can be a source of healing.

Support, ideally, is like a letter exchanged between equals. Helping, being helped—and still saying, "We live together."

We can still create such a society.
Five Principles for Redesigning Kindness: A Proposal from FUKU

FUKU proposes five principles for rethinking support and welfare:

Transform Support from "Charity" to "Connection"As long as support feels like a top-down favor, emotional equality is impossible. Instead of structures like "I help you, so I'm better," support should be a common platform accessible to all.

Example: A "Basic Support System," where all citizens receive a baseline of life support, with automatic extensions as needed. Public assistance becomes less of a stigma—more like a universal transportation card anyone may use.

Enable Those Receiving Support to Speak, Contribute, and Participate in OperationsPeople receiving aid shouldn't be passive. They should have opportunities to share their experience and contribute.

Examples:

Participate as knowledge providers in community projects
Peer support or dialogue centers operated by those with lived experience
Involvement in service design that reflects emotional and practical insights

Provide a Sense of Return for High-Income ContributorsMany high-income taxpayers feel unseen and unappreciated. That disconnect fuels resentment.

Examples:

Real-time reporting on the effects of support programs
Story-based feedback systems that show how their taxes changed someone's life
Support that feels meaningful creates understanding and pride.

Cultivate a "Public Aesthetic" Free from Shame and Contempt"Being helped is beautiful."
"Vulnerability is human, not shameful."

These values must be instilled through education, art, and daily life. This effort goes beyond systems—it tills the soil of empathy.

FUKU believes stories, culture, and literature can carry this aesthetic to the next generation.

Design All Support Systems Based on the Premise That Anyone May Temporarily Need HelpAnyone can become sick. Anyone can lose work. Anyone can become isolated.

Thus, systems should be designed as spaces anyone might temporarily enter.

FUKU's "Station" concept imagines a place—virtual or real—anyone can approach. When you're well, you can extend your hand. When you're hurting, it's where you can collapse.

Welfare is infrastructure for recovery.
Support is a permit to fall safely.

We Are Interdependent

In this society, people often speak in oppositions—"young vs. old," "taxpayer vs. recipient."
But the truth is: we all hold each other up.

Unseen, unheard, we affect one another in ways both small and profound.
We live not alone, but in connection.

Finally: Support Without Shame, Support With Hope

Don't feel ashamed for needing help.
Don't believe you have nothing to offer.

Wherever you stand, there's something only you can do.
Your voice, your presence—those are lights that soften the world.

Support is where hearts are restored.
Systems are opportunities to rebuild relationships.

The Future I Hope For

A society where being supported is not shameful is a society rich in imagination.A society where support is not a symbol of superiority is a society of equals.

The society I wish for is one where kindness makes us all equally human.
At its heart lies shared pain—and a shared future.
