We want to be a society that quietly affirms each person’s challenge.
A design philosophy of kindness envisioned by FUKU
by Yutaka Yoshioka

Everyone lives each day while making small, quiet challenges.
They may not be the kind of things we boast about—
but I believe they are beautiful all the same.

Getting out of bed in the morning.
Taking a train.
Putting on a smile.
Saying hello to someone.
Each of these “I did it” moments carries its own personal story.

Yet sadly, our society often shakes people off at invisible thresholds.
Especially for those with disabilities or illnesses,
there are countless moments when society unconsciously draws a line:
between “us” and “them.”

"Don’t push yourself too hard."
"If you can't do it, maybe you should give up."
"It’s easier if you just stay quiet."
These phrases, while they may sound considerate,
can silently crush the spirit of someone trying to move forward.

But I believe this:

Everyone has the right to challenge themselves.
Regardless of physical, intellectual, or emotional condition,
the act of choosing your own life is an essential human right.

Even the smallest act of courage nurtures richness of spirit,
cultivates self-worth, and over time, builds meaningful connections with society.

And yet…
Why is it that in today’s world, challenging oneself is often seen as an inconvenience?
Why are people with disabilities either pitied or condemned as "overstepping"?

Both responses, I believe, miss the mark of true empathy.

FUKU: Building kindness as a system
To answer these questions, I created a project called FUKU.

“FUKU” stands for:
Futurable – the will to shape the future.
Union – to walk together.
Kindness and Understanding – the pillars that support it all.

FUKU is not just a philosophy. It is a system.
A kind of operating system for kindness itself.

We don’t want kindness to depend on fleeting emotions or chance encounters.
We want to architect kindness into the structure of civilization itself—especially as AI continues to evolve.

Imagine this:

An app where someone in distress can record their voice.
A community where emotions can be safely shared.
An AI-powered support desk that makes decisions free from prejudice.

These small tools, we believe, can become lifelines.

No one deserves to be hurt
We sometimes hear voices online and in the real world that say:
“The weak should just endure it.”
or “People with disabilities should learn their place.”

Such words may seem like “tough love” or “realism,”
but in truth, they are nothing more than weapons to deny someone's dignity.

Let me be clear:

No one deserves to be hurt. Not a single soul.

People with disabilities, people with illness—they have every right to choose what they want to do.
They have every right to try.

And even if things don’t work out, that has nothing to do with their worth.

Kindness begins with not taking away someone’s voice
At FUKU, kindness does not mean comfort.
It does not mean shielding people from all hardship.
It does not mean expecting nothing.

Rather—

It means never taking away someone’s right to choose.
It means helping make sure their voice can be heard.

Kindness, at its core, is the choice not to silence.

In the end: To quietly affirm someone’s courage
There is still so much missing from our world in terms of what I call “empathy architecture.”
Even good intentions—when poorly communicated—can end up silencing the very people we wish to support.

That’s why FUKU continues to ask:

What is true kindness?

How can we create a world where more people can choose their own lives?

Maybe we can’t change everything overnight.
But with every piece of code, every shared word,
we are beginning to shape the outline of a gentler society.

If you, reading this now, are someone who can quietly affirm another person’s courage—
then I am deeply grateful.

If you’re interested in FUKU
FUKU is still a new and growing concept.
But when someone wants to move forward,
we want to be a place where they feel safe to think aloud—together.

With kindness,
Yutaka Yoshioka
