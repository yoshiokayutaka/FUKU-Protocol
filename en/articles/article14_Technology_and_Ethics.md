"The Day Kindness Reshapes Our Systems" — A Vision of Technology and Ethics Through the Lens of the FUKU Initiative

Today’s Rice Ball and the Story of Invisible Hands
This morning, as I took a bite of a rice ball I’d bought at a convenience store, a thought quietly surfaced:

“Who made this rice ball for me?”

Perhaps it was shaped by a machine in a factory.
But someone had to clean that machine.
Someone grew the rice.
Someone drove the truck that delivered it.
And someone placed it gently on the shelf.

When I think about it, it feels as if this one small rice ball holds within it the quiet labor of countless invisible people.

That’s a beautiful thought.

But at the same time, another, more troubling one arises:

“What if these ingredients were harvested through child labor in a developing country?”
“What if the logistics network that brought this rice ball to me includes technologies repurposed for military use?”

Is it too painful to think like this?
Maybe.
But I believe that kindness means having the courage to look at what we would rather not see.

Turning Kindness Into a System: The Five Pillars of FUKU
FUKU is a blueprint to ensure that kindness and compassion don’t end as emotions, but become part of our social infrastructure.

Here are five practical directions FUKU envisions to help eliminate structural harm in the world:

Mandatory Transparency (Ethical Traceability)
Today, many products are hidden behind black boxes.
That’s why the first step is visibility—making transparent how things are made, transported, and designed.

FUKU proposes:
Ethical disclosures at every stage: production, design, logistics
Introducing a "FUKU Ethical Label" to show a product’s origin and environmental/social footprint
Example: “This T-shirt was produced with fair-trade labor and emitted 3.2kg of CO₂ during transport.”
This kind of transparency opens the door to a society that no longer pretends not to know.

Declaration and Contract of Non-Military Use
What if the app you built, the parts you designed, or the algorithm you developed were unknowingly used in a weapon?

FUKU proposes formalizing contracts that limit technologies to peaceful purposes:
Implementing “Non-Military Use Licenses” for software, hardware, and designs
Promoting “Peaceful Use Agreements” for AI and semiconductor technologies
Publishing a FUKU-developed Technology Ethics Agreement Template that developers, researchers, and companies can freely use
This isn’t law—it’s intention.
A future built on values, not loopholes.

FUKU Certification (FUKU Certified)
Some people want to make choices with intention—not just for price or taste, but for ethics.

To support this, FUKU will introduce a certification system for products and services that meet specific kindness-based standards, such as:
Ethical labor practices
Non-military development
Contribution to equity and justice
Example: A convenience store bento labeled “FUKU Certified: Fair Labor / Peaceful Logistics.”
Soon, people will care not only about how something tastes, but whether someone was harmed in bringing it to their table.

Ethical Return Design: Redistributing Profit to Heal Harm
What if a small portion of profits went directly to places bearing the world’s silent suffering?

FUKU calls this “Ethical Return Design.”

Redistributing 1–5% of profits to structurally disadvantaged people and regions: exploited communities, refugees, war veterans

Making the destinations of these funds transparent through the FUKU Fund

Example: The FUKU Fund supports child laborers in Congolese cobalt mines by offering protection and access to education.

This is about more than money.
It’s about healing what was damaged, and nurturing what was neglected.
It’s about redrawing lines of hope across places once written off.

Structural Education: Ethics of Kindness in Schools
Before we raise the next generation of engineers and consumers, we need to nurture their capacity to imagine.

FUKU proposes adding curriculum nationwide to teach students:
“Where do the parts in this smartphone come from?”
“Who paid the hidden cost for this cheap T-shirt?”
The goal isn’t just to teach facts, but to offer space to think.
That’s how we grow the roots of a society built on ethics.

In Closing: Can Kindness Really Reshape Our Systems?
You don’t have to carry everything alone.
But once you've seen the truth, you are already part of the beginning.

FUKU is an attempt to translate kindness from feeling into structure.
Not just goodwill—but design.
Not just empathy—but systems.
Not just emotion—but ethics that breathe.

And in doing so, we believe we can build a world where we all feel just a little more able to breathe.

The day kindness reshapes our systems—
That is the future FUKU envisions.
