For Those Who Wish to Build the Future with Kindness and Imagination

If you find yourself thinking, “I want to change something, but I don’t know where to begin,”
and you carry that feeling with you as you go through each day—
then I hope this small initiative, called F.U.K.U, can be a place for you.

F.U.K.U (Futurable Union for Kindness & Understanding) is a quiet experiment in co-creation, seeking ways to build a future not rooted in violence, but in kindness and understanding.
There are no membership fees, no registration forms, no hierarchies.

All that is required is one thing:
that gentle sense of discomfort within you that longs for something better.

Participation in F.U.K.U Is Open and Free-Form
F.U.K.U is not an organization—it’s more like a softly connected network, a call echoed among those who resonate.
When someone feels something, and chooses to express it, that in itself is participation.

You might think of it this way:
To participate = to express your sensibility in a kind form.
Here are some simple ways you can join in—starting right now.

3 Simple Steps to Participate
1.Express your thoughts in your own words

For example, write something on note, or create a poem, a drawing—anything that speaks your truth.
The theme can be anything: “What is kindness?”, “How do we look at what we can’t understand?”
Putting such questions into your own words is the very first step.

2.Use hashtags to connect (#FUKU, #FUKUInitiative , etc.)

Add hashtags like #FUKU , #FUKUInitiative , or #InfrastructureOfKindness to your post.
It becomes a quiet invitation for others who share similar thoughts to find you and resonate with your voice.

3.Reach out to a project—or start your own

F.U.K.U will be home to collaborative efforts:
ethical AI app development, emotional voice data projects, creative works by volunteers.
To participate, all you need to say is, “I want to be part of this.”
And of course, you are also welcome to start a project of your own.

Who Is This For?

Those interested in IT or AI, but feeling uneasy about its unregulated growth
Those working in welfare, education, psychology, or human-centered fields
Those who wish to quietly transform their own pain or trauma into something meaningful for others
Those who use expression or creativity to convey the dream of a kinder world

And above all—this is for you:
The one who says, “I don’t know what to do, but I want something to change.”

In Closing
The “U” in F.U.K.U stands not only for “Union,”
but also for “You.”

This blueprint for the future cannot be completed without you.
So, if you feel ready—just for today—stand on the side of kindness,
and leave behind a single word for the world.
That one word from you might become a “word of salvation” for someone else.
