Antidote to Prejudice: How FUKU Sheds Light on Living with the Feeling of Dislike

【The Antidote to Prejudice】
〜How FUKU Softens Hatred and Bias〜
“I just don’t like that person.”

Saying those words often carries a tinge of guilt.
As if disliking someone is wrong.
As if we must accept, understand, or embrace everyone.

…But is that really true?

■ Dislike is not a sin
Humans dislike others.
It’s a natural part of being alive.
Memories of hurt, unfair treatment, betrayal—
these accumulate and take root in us as aversion or bias.

But the emotion of “dislike” itself isn’t evil.
In fact, it’s one of the instinctive defenses we develop to protect ourselves.

The problem arises when we treat that dislike as a permanent truth.
When that happens, the world narrows.
Breathing becomes harder.
That’s why FUKU gently asks:

“Can you leave a little space around your ‘dislike’?”

■ Prejudice is grief that was never heard
It’s easy to categorize people.

“Old people are all pushy.”
“Young people are disrespectful.”
“Women are too emotional.”
“Men are all about logic.”

But behind most prejudices lie misunderstood feelings:
A personal wound inflicted by a specific person.
The anger of being abandoned.
The loneliness of never being able to talk about it.

If that person who hurt you was elderly,
distrust of “all elders” may grow in your heart.
If it was a teacher, or a woman, or a man—
the memory gets locked up under the label of an entire group.

But the truth is:
an individual caused the pain, yet the entire category gets condemned.

■ The FUKU Perspective: Respecting the Right Not to Empathize
FUKU doesn’t seek a world where we must “understand everyone” or “love all.”
What we propose is something quieter—gentler: a small shift.

“I dislike that person. That’s okay.
But… why do I dislike them?”

This question isn’t for anyone else.
It’s for yourself.
Left unexamined, “dislike” stiffens, shrinks your heart’s mobility.

FUKU respects your freedom not to empathize, your right to refrain from understanding.
Even so, we want to offer a faint light to broaden your view—
that light is a willingness to try to understand,
the very spirit of Kindness & Understanding,
which lies at FUKU’s core.

■ Prejudice can’t be erased by knowledge alone—it needs experience
Education and awareness campaigns are necessary.
But in reality, prejudices soften not through facts, but through personal, accidental encounters.

“Old people are just annoying.”
—Someone thinks that, until a kind smile from an elderly stranger softens their shoulders.

“Foreigners are scary.”
—Someone says that, until they’re helped during a trip and moved to tears.

This is how bias melts—through encounter, not argument.
Not by lectures. Not by debates.
Just by an unexpected moment with another human being.

FUKU aims to create spaces for those encounters to happen.
We don’t force, or preach.
We simply prepare a gentle warm-up ground for those willing to look,
and perhaps… to understand.

■ In Conclusion: “Dislike” is not the end
Everyone carries bias and hatred within.
It’s simply part of being human.

But even if you keep your dislike—just pause with it for a moment.

That alone can start changing the world.

There will always be people we can’t understand.
That’s okay.
But we don’t have to hate each other.

Kindness isn’t about forgiving everything.
Understanding isn’t about becoming the same.

The true future FUKU envisions
is a world where we coexist while holding our differences gently.
Not a world without prejudice—
but a world where we can live more easily alongside it.
