【F.U.K.U. Safety Framework v1.0】Design Principles to Protect the Freedom of the Future

Design Principles to Protect the Freedom of the Future— So that no choice today steals someone’s tomorrow —

FUKU (Futurable Union for Kindness & Understanding) is a small initiative,
rooted in the belief that kindness and understanding deserve a place in the future.

It is not a treaty.
It is not a rulebook.
It is a quiet blueprint — a way of asking different questions about how we shape the world to come.

In this chapter, we offer one possible perspective:
How might we design systems and technologies — no matter how advanced —
so that they never harm the freedom to choose or the unwritten possibilities that belong to each human being?

What it means to protect future freedom...
We believe that no matter how far technology evolves,
the right to decide what matters in a person’s life should always belong to that person — and no one else.

The future must never be closed off by someone’s “prediction.”
It must remain open.

“The future is unwritten.”
Every life is still a story in progress.

This is a core value FUKU seeks to protect.

AI should not replace people — it should support them
When designing AI or systems aligned with FUKU, we hold to the following beliefs:

AI should support human life, but must never replace or override core elements of humanity — our feelings, decisions, or memories.

Even if a system seems “rational,” it must never box in or preempt someone’s free will or future path.

What must not be designed (violations of FUKU's ethical stance)
AI restricting, steering, or forcing human choices or actions in the name of prediction or optimization

Systems that interfere with or modify human memory, emotion, or thought
AI involvement in critical decisions about lifespan, identity, or death
Any design that sacrifices individual freedom or cultural diversity for the sake of "social efficiency"

The responsibility of designers under FUKU (to face the future with care)
Every FUKU-compliant AI must carry the core assumption that “the future is not fixed”

Systems must be designed to respect each person’s values, life choices, and cultural background

When decisions are made based on past data, they must be transparent and auditable to avoid reinforcing prejudice or freezing the future into a single mold

In closing...
The future is someone’s place that hasn’t yet begun.

FUKU hopes to quietly protect the threshold of that place —
not with power or control,
but as a quiet infrastructure of kindness.

May this chapter become one small wish toward a better tomorrow.
And may it never be used as a seed for extremist thought.
