// This system stands on four fractures of human experience.
// Handle with care.

// What if empathy was the only required dependency?
// How would you install it?
// Where is the --force flag for kindness?


// ----------------------------------------
//   Notes on the Design Philosophy
// ----------------------------------------

// This is not just a tool for the 21st century.
// It is an attempt to design the *heart* of the 21st century.
//
// The century has already begun. The satellites are flying,
// the algorithms are learning, and yet—
// the systems meant to carry empathy, care, and support
// are still stuck somewhere in the 20th.
//
// Technology has moved on, but compassion remains uncompiled.
// Our protocols are precise, but kindness still lacks interoperability.
//
// Perhaps the future has not arrived
// because someone keeps delaying it.
// Or perhaps it is we ourselves, unknowingly hesitating.
//
// Even so, this code speaks softly:
// “What we have is not enough.”
//
// This is a quiet act of resistance—
// a belief that *designing kindness* is part of what makes a true future.
